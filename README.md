## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [REST Countries](https://restcountries.eu/) - API
- [Iconmoon](https://iconmoon.io/) - Icons

### What I learned

-While building this project, I was able to use a REST API for the first time and it was a lot of fun. 

-I learned how to catch errors as well as make my own custom error messages for a better user experience using Fetch API. 

-I was able to implement a better method of adding media queries for responsivene design by using the power of SASS mixins. 

-This project allowed me to practice and enhance my SASS skills. 

-I incorporated icons here using svg and use tags with sprite files. I liked how easy this method makes styling svg icons in CSS.

### Continued development

-This project introduced me to the power of Web APIs. I will continue to practice the usage of them in more efficient methods in the future.

-I was very satisfied with the responsiveness of this website and how easy this was to implement because of SASS and Flexbox, so I will start to make my future projects with the methods I used here until I discover an even better method.

### Useful resources

- [Theme Modes](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSYNGPPj16R/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link/) - This helped me implement the light and dark mode themes. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
